/* There are N coins, each showing either heads or tails. 
We would like all the coins to form a sequence of alternation heads and tails. 
What is the minimum number of coins that must be reversed to achieve this?

Write a function
function solution(A)

that, given an array A consisting of N integers representing the coins, returns the minimum number of coins that must be reversed.
Consecutive elements of array A represent consecutive coins and contain either a 0(heads) or a 1(tails)*/

/*
Example
1. Given array A=[1,0,1,0,1,1], the function should return 1. After reversing the six coin, we achieve an alternating sequence of coins [1,0,1,0,1,0].

2. Given array A=[1,1,0,1,1], the function should return1. After reversing the first and fifth coins, we achieve an alternating sequence [0,1,0,1,0].

3. Given array A=[0,1,0]
